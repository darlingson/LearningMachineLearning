Linear regression
- regression is a type of supervised learning
- values will be continous

How it works
- works on scattered data
- a straight called the hypotheses is fitted through the scattered data
- uses the theta function to find the hypothesis
- cost function is used to evaluate a model
	- calculates the distance between predicted and actual values
	- The higher the cost, the less acurate the model
- The gradient descent algorithm helps in optimizing the value of theta
- normal equation gives optimal theta in one go

Assumptions of Linear regression
- Linear relationship
